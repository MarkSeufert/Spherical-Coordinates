# Spherical Navigator
An application that allows the user to graphically select two points on the earth, and then view the shortest distance between them. This project was made in Unity3d using javascript (this was before I realized c# is better) and contains an executable file for windows. 

### How to use the application:
- Open the "SphericalCoordinates_Executable" folder and run the SphericalCoordinates.exe file
- Hold right click while panning the mouse to rotate around the earth
- Click on the "Point1" or "Point2" text on the left side and then click on the earth to place that point. Once both points are placed the shortest distance between them will be displayed.
- Use the scrollwheel to zoom in and out on the earth
- Use the slider in the top right corner to change the time of day
